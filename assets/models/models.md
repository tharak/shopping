Display an AR Experience in Your Web Page
In your web page, you enable AR Quick Look by linking a supported input file.

<div>
    <a rel="ar" href="/assets/models/my-model.usdz">
        <img src="/assets/models/my-model-thumbnail.jpg">
    </a>
</div>
When the user clicks the link in Safari or within a web view that's displayed in your app, iOS presents your scene in an AR Quick Look view on your behalf. For more information, see Viewing Augmented Reality Assets in Safari for iOS.
